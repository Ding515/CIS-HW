PA2_DEMO.py command lines to finish the PA2 based on functions from PA2_functions.py
A direct change in dir and file name can work on more datasets

PA2_functions.py contains the utilization function for each question, including getting the C_expect(Q1),
fitting the distortion correction function(Q2), compute the corrected value,frame_pivot_calibration(Q3),
fiducial_coordinate_em(Q4),F_reg(Q5) and EM_CT_transformation(Q6).

There are also some small functions which is utilized by the above primary functions in PA2. 
We write them seperately to make the projects more readable.

Other parts in PA1 is saved for PA2_function using.

For more details, please read the PA2_DEMO.py for a delineate I/O of each function; read the 
PA2_functions.py for a detailed description for each functions and the REPORT algorithm part
for the designing method and math details.

All of the middle result used in the functions is saved in the OUTPUT files for both debug and unknown mode.
